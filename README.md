# 🌿 FocusFlow

**FocusFlow** is a simple and clean productivity tool designed for students who want to organize tasks and stay focused, especially those who struggle with distraction and procrastination, like me. I'm currently working on this as a solo and looking for someone interested in contributing and helping me build it further. 🤝

Built with 💻 HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — and it saves tasks using `localStorage`.
